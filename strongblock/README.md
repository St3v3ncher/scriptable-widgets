*Two separate widgets showing single- and double-digit reward amounts.  
(When inputting two wallets their sum will be displayed in a single widget)*

### How to use
* Download the Scriptable App from the App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188
* Open the Scriptable App and click the `+` in the top right of the screen and copy and paste the code into the new empty script
* Now copy and paste your wallet address on the 17th line of the script, only replace the `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_WALLET`. Check the comments in the script for a more exact syntax.
* The name of the script should also be changed, to do so click on the settings button (left) in the bar on the bottom left (above the keyboard).  
  Change the name to something fitting, e.g. `StrongBlock Rewards`, the color and icon can also be changed if desired.
* After doing all the above listed things go to the home screen where you want the widget.  
  Hold the screen and go into 'wiggle mode', in the top left click on the `+` and search for Scriptable and add the small widget.
* Click on the widget you just added and select the script. Personally I also always change the "When Interacting" to `Run Script`.
